# Project 1 - Gradient Descent Methods,


$\mathbf{Goal: }$ To solve the optimal control problem. 
 
The report presents 3 optimization methods to solve this optimal control problem:
1. Steepest gradient descent with Amijo search for step-size $\alpha$,
2. Steepest gradient descent with exact search for step-size $\alpha$,
3. Conjugate gradient descent
